# plate-planner-api

API for Plate Planner application

I'm developing this API to harden my skills with the following technologies:

- RESTful API with Spring MVC
- Spring Data [with Hibernate]
- Logback
- Spring Validation [Java Validator (JSR-303)]
- Spring Security
- Spring Cache [with EHCache]
- Maven
- Testing with jUnit and Mockito
- Documentation via Swagger and Javadoc
- Java 8 (new java.time library, functional programming via lambdas, etc)
